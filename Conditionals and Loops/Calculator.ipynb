    "\n",
    "1. If the input is 1, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their sum is printed.\n",
    "2. If the input is 2, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their difference(1st number - 2nd number) is printed.\n",
    "3. If the input is 3, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their product is printed.\n",
    "4. If the input is 4, then 2 integers are taken from the user and the quotient obtained (on dividing 1st number by 2nd number) is printed.\n",
    "5. If the input is 5, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their remainder(1st number mod 2nd number) is printed.\n",
    "6. If the input is 6, then the program exits.\n",
